Docker commands:
	docker run -p 3307:3306 --name accountsdb -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root -e MYSQL_DATABASE=accountsdb -d mysql
	-creating & running a docker container, with name as accountsdb, and setting environment variable(using -e) MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root
		which creates a password for this server, MYSQL_DATABASE=accountsdb -> by using this we're creating one database by default inside the
		cloud server with name accountsdb, -d -> detached mode, mysql -> mysql command
		
		-p -> port
		3307:3306 -> 3307, is port using in local machine
					3306 -> is port used inside container in isolated environment
		
	similary create containers for cards and loands usign below commands
		docker run -p 3308:3306 --name cardsdb -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root -e MYSQL_DATABASE=cardsdb -d mysql
		docker run -p 3309:3306 --name loansdb -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root -e MYSQL_DATABASE=loansdb -d mysql
		
Connecting to these servers using SQLectron:
	
		SQLectron -> is a light weight gui which enables us to connect to db servers even cloud ones.
		Inside this we can add our accounts, loans & cards servers using add feature inside the app
		while adding you should also give necessary information like user name and password, port, hostname, etc;
		- After adding these configurations, you can verify by clicking connect and check if the desired db is present or not
		
	Also remember that these docker db containers are just like your local mysql db, whenever you uninstall mysql app in your
		machine you'll lose all your data in database
		same happens, if you delete the db containers, you'll lose whole data so, please be very careful as we're in local
		the access to whole data will be lost
