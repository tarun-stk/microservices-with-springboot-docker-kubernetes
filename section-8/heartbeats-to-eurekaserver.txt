Heatbeats:
	individual microservices send regular heartbeats to eurekaserver, for every 30 seconds (default time)
	if you want to confirm this in action
	you can stop the eurekaserver app, by clicking stop running app in IDE
	then if you see logs of running microservices, there you can see exceptions saying that *was unable to send hearbeats to eurekaserver*
	this happened because eurekaserver is not running in the background.
	This confirms that microservices send regular heartbeats to the eurekaserver.
