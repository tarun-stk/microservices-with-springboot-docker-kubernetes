DOCKER commands:

	

	docker built . -t username/microservicename:tagname
	- building the docker image, first go to root project folder where you've Dockerfile then open cmd and execute this command
	- this will generate docker image with name that you've given in place of microservicename
	- and tagname will be what you've given in place of tagname
	- this is the standard way of creating docker images, always follow username/microservicename:tagname  -> this pattern
	- username is nothing but your docker username
	
	docker ps
	- lists down all running containers
	
	docker start container_id
	- starts running the container with container_id
	
	docker stop container_id
	- stops running the container with container_id
	
	docker run -p 8080:8080 tarunkumarstk/accounts:s4
	- creates the container for the given docker image(tarunkumarstk/accounts:s4) on port 8080
	- when you do this all the logs of app will be running in cmd, and you can't do anything parallely in cmd
	- as we're seeing app logs
	- if you want to want to run container,and don't want to see any logs use below command
	docker run -d -p 8080:8080 tarunkumarstk/accounts:s4
	- -d means detached, run in detached mode, now cmd won't show any app logs
